## Notes

Tried to unhide the tab bar within the navigation back action but didn't make it work. Probably the reason is the reference to the view controller is not right. I read online that the back button on the current view actually belongs to the previous view controller. But at last I decided to do the unhiding action in the viewWillAppear function because have spent too much time on this issue...

Spent quite some time to finish the scroll view and tab bar controller before I realized there are some walkthrough videos at the bottom of the assignment page...
